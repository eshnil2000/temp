Welcome to AIOBench's Learn platform! Here you'll find step-by-step examples of how to perform common Real World Application/ workload Performance Analysis tasks without requiring a PhD in Cloud DevOps using AIOBench's Low Code platform.

This "AIOBench Basics" section of Learn will help you understand how you can easily Analyze real world 3 tier Application performance by generating complex real world Applications using components like NGINX, MySQL, Wordpress and generating real world load conditions using Locust . We will walk through setting up a simple 3 tier Cloud Application, configuring user load, launching the App in the cloud and then evaluating results/ analyzing for hotspots, all without writing a single line of code. We'll also show you how you can drill down and visualize detailed metrics like CPU Utilization, Memory, etc to give you some idea into diagnostics.
